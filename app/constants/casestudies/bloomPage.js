      'The Process: We started off the project by scheduling a series of workshops with the client to better understand the value they are contributing to the hospitality industry, as well as the unique offerings for the customers. As a result of this, we not only simplified our own planning process but also had a clearer picture of the MVP and ultimate product. This enabled us to create the best hotel management software. With a clear roadmap, we began work on Bloom’s deliverables. We leveraged a variety of tools and technology, such as Angular, Node, SQL, Redis and AWS S3 to develop the deliverables. As a team, we implemented an Agile workflow and ensured that the client could be a part of every stage of development. With this, we were able to implement feedback, redirect efforts, and brainstorm on the go without losing any time.',

    title: 'The Result',
    description:
      'Despite a tight timeline, we were armed with a strong knowledge base and an ever-relentless can- do attitude, which is what enabled us to deliver a world-class PWA for Bloom. The PWA was built after monitoring the behavioral patterns of the client’s target audience, in order to ensure easy onboarding, great functionality, and appealing aesthetics. We implemented a variety of APIs in the backend to achieve the best SEO in the domain. As a result, our client saw not only phenomenally high user retention over time, but also an SEO score of 100, accessibility score of 100, best practises score of 100 and an overall performance score of 91! Knowing that customer data is one of most important tools in the hospitality industry, we built a responsive CMS for the client that not only stored accurate data, but also updated the content on the PWA. To enhance the overall speed and performance, we migrated the codebase from typescript to javascript. Our A/B testing reduced the overall number of jobs required to finish the project on time, and also reduced the effort required for monitoring each and every task. In short, our team worked together to build a highly-efficient, comprehensive hotel property management software for a client on the cusp of disrupting the travel and hospitality industry. We were proud to be a part of their journey!',
