      question: 'How is Primathon different from other Software development companies?',
      answer:
        'Founded by the Alumni of IIT-Delhi, Primathon is positioned as a premium software development company. We have seen businesses struggling with outsourced products built by service companies. After working in the industry, we found that there is one key issue â€“ quality of the code & the software. It looks and works all good from the outside but making changes later becomes a headache. It becomes really painful to scale them. So, at Primathon, we make high quality solutions with user friendly documentation.',
